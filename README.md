# rockpaperscissors!
A rock paper scissors game developed with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

I developed this game to practice some CSS and JavaScript concepts I learnt on Scrimba.
The game was created as a spin off from the rock paper scissors game in Scrimba's making websites interactive module.

In this game, you will play against the computer that will randomly select either rock, paper or scissors and your goal is to predict a winning hand.
